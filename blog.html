     <!-- hellow welcome to my blog-->
<div>So far in computers we have learned the basics about HTML (hypertext markup link). We have learned about Tabs,Tables, Links, and Images. Tabs are use so the computer can identify specific parts of the whole HTML. For example each tab has a specific role so the html can identify its purpose, some of the many tabs are  h2,h1,p,a,div, li,ect. Each tab has to be opened with a less than and greater then sign and closed with a / between the less than and greater than sign , so it can function properly. An example of the tab is the p tab, this tab is used to embed a paragraph, this (p) is placed at the beginning of the paragraph and ends with a  /p. When we place this tabes we are indicating that the content within the tabs is a paragraph and later we can stye this specific paragraph with css. Using tables we have learned to create tables using sets of tabs. When we use this sets of tabs, table,thead,tr, th, we are able to create a table. This tables can be used for any purpose and with css they can changed and dressed up.</div>
<div>We have also been learning about links and how to add them into our HTML. To add a link into your HTML/Website you have to start with  a tab which contains a  href=" " inside. This will link the content inside the a tab to the specific id you mention in the #, then finally you end it with /a tab. This can be used in two different ways, with a link within the website, or a link outside. For a link within the website you just need to add an idea to what you want to link and add the id within the quotations using a #, for example "#id". For an external link you have to add the url into the quotations, for example "https://wikipidia.org". Another thing that we have learned to far, is how to incorporate images into our HTML. To add a imig we first have to search for images which are free to use, most of wikipedias images are, the copy the images address.Next you have to add img src="". Inside the quotation you paste the image address, for example img src="https://wikiimige//">. Inside this tab you can also add alt="HTML", which indicates what the image is about, and width="200" so you can adjust the haight and width of your imige tofit your website.So in the end it will look like img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/com<br>mons/thumb/8/80/Woman-typing-on-laptop.jpg/1024px-Woman-typing-on-laptop.jpg" alt="HTML" width="200". To conclude to far we have learned how to add Tabs,Tables, Links, and Images Into our HTML.</div>

       <div>We have also learned how to style our web pages using CSS (Cascading Style Sheet). In css we learned how to design our web pages and how to style our HTML. Some of the things we have learned is how to style our texts. Firstly for our style to appear in our product we have to add the thing we are styling for example our h2 or p and add {}, so all our styling is inside the curly braces. Then by adding  Color: rgb();(you insert the scale you want to create a color) we are able to change the texts colore to whatever pigment you want. We can add color to our texts and make our pages more interesting, and you can add different colors to different texts in your html. Another thing you can add to style your HTML is add a background color to your text. By adding background-color:rgb(your colore); inside the curly braces, you are able to add a background to your text. To align your text you can also add text-align:, the  you chose either right, left or center. This moves your text to were you direct it to placing it in different positions.</div>
       <div>Other cool things you can use to style your HTML texts are differents fonts, font sizes, and font style. To change our text fonts you add font-family: inside your curly braces with the rest of you css styling. This is followed by your choice of fonts, for example 'ZCOOL QingKe HuangYou'. This can be followed by a backup font in case the computer doesn't read that font, you can add ,your font here;. To change the size of your text you add font-size:. Then add the size you want, for example 40px followed by a ;. This will change the size of your text to your preferable size, and you can change different texts to different sizes. You can also style your text by adding italics to specific parts of your text. By adding font-style: italic; you can change your text to italics. To conclude to far we have learned to style our HTML by using colore, background color, text alignment, and learned how to add differents fonts, font sizes, and font style.
